# roslyn.nvim

This is an actively maintained & upgraded [fork](https://github.com/jmederosalvarado/roslyn.nvim) that interacts with the improved & open-source C# [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) language server, meant to replace the old and discontinued OmniSharp. This language server is currently used in the [Visual Studio Code C# Extension](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp), which is shipped with the standard C# Dev Kit.

This standalone plugin was necessary because Roslyn uses a [non-standard](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72871) method of initializing communication with the client and requires additional custom integrations, unlike typical LSP setups in Neovim.

## IMPORTANT

This plugin does not provide Razor support.

Check out https://github.com/tris203/rzls.nvim if you are using Razor.

## ⚡️ Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.10.0
- Roslyn language server downloaded locally
- .NET SDK installed and `dotnet` command available

## Demo

## 📦 Installation

<details>
  <summary>Mason</summary>
  
  `roslyn` is not in the mason core registry, so a custom registry is used. This is automatically setup if you have mason installed.
  This registry provides two binaries
  - `roslyn` (To be used with this repo)
  - `rzls` (To be used with [rzls.nvim](https://github.com/tris203/rzls.nvim))

You can then install it with `:MasonInstall roslyn` or through the popup menu by running `:Mason`. It is not available through [mason-lspconfig.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) and the `:LspInstall` interface

**IMPORTANT**

If you are setting up mason with custom registries, make sure that you are either setting it up before `roslyn.nvim` is setup, or also include `github:Crashdummyy/mason-registry` in your `registries` config

**NOTE**

There's currently an open [pull request](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry/pull/6330) to add the Roslyn server to [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim), which would greatly improve the experience. If you are interested in this, please react to the original comment, but don't spam the thread with unnecessary comments.

  <summary>Manually</summary>
  
  1. Navigate to [this feed](https://dev.azure.com/azure-public/vside/_artifacts/feed/vs-impl), search for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer` and download the version matching your OS and architecture.
     > For nix users, install [roslyn-ls](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=roslyn-ls) and then you can config this plugin right away.
  2. Unzip the downloaded `.nupkg` and copy the contents of `<zip root>/content/LanguageServer/<yourArch>` inside:
     - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/nvim/roslyn`
     - **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim-data\roslyn`
       > **_TIP:_** You can also specify a custom path to the roslyn folder in the setup function.
  3. Check if it's working by running `dotnet Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll --version` in the `roslyn` directory.

**Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:**

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    "seblyng/roslyn.nvim",
    ft = "cs",
    opts = {
        -- your configuration comes here; leave empty for default settings
    }
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The plugin comes with the following defaults:

```lua
{
    config = {
        -- Here you can pass in any options that that you would like to pass to `vim.lsp.start`.
        -- Use `:h vim.lsp.ClientConfig` to see all possible options.
        -- The only options that are overwritten and won't have any effect by setting here:
        --     - `name`
        --     - `cmd`
        --     - `root_dir`
    },

    --[[
    -- if you installed `roslyn-ls` by nix, use the following:
      exe = 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer',
    ]]
    exe = {
        "dotnet",
        vim.fs.joinpath(vim.fn.stdpath("data"), "roslyn", "Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.dll"),
    },
    args = {
        "--logLevel=Information", "--extensionLogDirectory=" .. vim.fs.dirname(vim.lsp.get_log_path())
    },
  --[[
  -- args can be used to pass additional flags to the language server
    ]]

    -- NOTE: Set `filewatching` to false if you experience performance problems.
    -- Defaults to true, since turning it off is a hack.
    -- If you notice that the server is _super_ slow, it is probably because of file watching
    -- Neovim becomes super unresponsive on some large codebases, because it schedules the file watching on the event loop.
    -- This issue goes away by disabling this capability, but roslyn will fallback to its own file watching,
    -- which can make the server super slow to initialize.
    -- Setting this option to false will indicate to the server that neovim will do the file watching.
    -- However, in `hacks.lua` I will also just don't start off any watchers, which seems to make the server
    -- a lot faster to initialize.
    filewatching = true,

    -- Optional function that takes an array of targets as the only argument. Return the target you
    -- want to use. If it returns `nil`, then it falls back to guessing the target like normal
    -- Example:
    --
    -- choose_target = function(target)
    --     return vim.iter(target):find(function(item)
    --         if string.match(item, "Foo.sln") then
    --             return item
    --         end
    --     end)
    -- end
    choose_target = nil,

    -- Optional function that takes the selected target as the only argument.
    -- Returns a boolean of whether it should be ignored to attach to or not
    --
    -- I am for example using this to disable a solution with a lot of .NET Framework code on mac
    -- Example:
    --
    -- ignore_target = function(target)
    --     return string.match(target, "Foo.sln") ~= nil
    -- end
    ignore_target = nil,

    -- Whether or not to look for solution files in the child of the (root).
    -- Set this to true if you have some projects that are not a child of the
    -- directory with the solution file
    broad_search = false,

    -- Whether or not to lock the solution target after the first attach.
    -- This will always attach to the target in `vim.g.roslyn_nvim_selected_solution`.
    -- NOTE: You can use `:Roslyn target` to change the target
    lock_target = false,
})
```

To configure language server specific settings sent to the server, you can modify the `config.settings` map.

## 📚 Commands

- `:Roslyn restart` restarts the server
- `:Roslyn stop` stops the server
- `:Roslyn target` chooses a solution if there are multiple to chose from

## 🚀 Other usage

- If you have multiple solutions, this plugin tries to guess which one to use. You can change the target with the `:Roslyn target` command.
- The current solution is always stored in `vim.g.roslyn_nvim_selected_solution`. You can use this, for example, to display the current solution in your statusline.
